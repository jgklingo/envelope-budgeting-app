# Envelope Budgeting App
This project is a budgeting app that prioritizes ease of use and simplicity, enabling anyone to create a budget and start improving their financial wellbeing with minimal time investment. Budgeting apps are a pretty saturated space, but many of them are overly complicated and require too much work for people to stick with them. Even worse, many of them follow a subscription monetization model, and the last thing that someone working to improve their finances needs is another subscription. This app aims to address these and other issues, making simple, straightforward budgeting more accessible to the masses.
 
### Key Features
- Follows the envelope budgeting system, where all incoming money is divided into different spending (and savings) envelopes. Outgoing money is subtracted from the envelopes based on category, and the app shows how much money is remaining in each envelope.
- Envelopes can be set up and forgotten, or adjusted as time goes on. Each envelope takes a percentage or constant amount of your incoming money.
- Ideally, Plaid APIs (or similar) will be used to pull transaction (income and expense) data directly from your financial institution. If this is not feasible, this data will be entered manually through a simple form in the app.
  - Plaid or the user will categorize the transaction, and the app will use the category to determine which envelope it should count against.
